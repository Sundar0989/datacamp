# Multiple and Logistic Regression



## Chapter 1 - Univariate Regression
   * Lesson 1.1 - Anova, Anova Assumptions and Correlation
     * Learning objective: Introduce Anova, talk about assumptions of Anova, Understand the linear relationship between two variables using correlation. Why correlation cannot be used to predict a variable outcome? Also, learn to write the codes in python to test anova, its assumption and to calculate correlation metrics. 
   * Lesson 1.2 - Parametric vs Non-parametric models, Deterministic vs Stochastic models
     * Learning objective: Understand the difference between each model types. How regression falls under the parametric-stochastic models category?
   * Lesson 1.3 - Univariate Regression
     * Learning objective: What is Simple Linear Regression or Univariate Regression? How can regression used to predict a variable outcome? Examples.
## Chapter 2 - Multiple Regression
   * Lesson 2.1 - Introduction to Multiple Regression
     * Learning objective: Introduce multiple regression concepts to students and provide examples
   * Lesson 2.2 - Fit Multiple Regression
     * Learning objective: Use python to fit the Multiple regression model using two different packages - statsmodels and sklearn.
   * Lesson 2.3 - Parameter estimates
     * Learning objective: How to interpret the model parameter estimates from Linear regression fit? What is the significance of each estimates?
   * Lesson 2.4 - Evaluate model fit, Multicollinearity and select the best model
     * Learning objective: Talk about the different metrics used to evaluate a regression model fit (R-squared, Adjusted R-squared, F-statistic and other metrics) and how these metrics can be used to select the best model. Also, how to check multicollinearity using VIF?
## Chapter 3 - Logistic Regression
   * Lesson 3.1 - Introduction to Logistic Regression
     * Learning objective: Introduce logsitc regression concepts to students. Provide examples for logistic regression(binary) outcome prediction. Explain why linear regression cannot be used to predict binary outcome? Also, explain how the same algorithm can be used to predict multinomial outcome (will not be covered in depth in lecture)
   * Lesson 3.2 - Fit Logistic Regression
     * Learning objective: Use python to fit the Logistic regression model using two different packages - statsmodels and sklearn.
   * Lesson 3.3 - Parameter estimates and odds ratio
     * Learning objective: How to interpret the model parameter estimates from Logistic regression fit? What is the significance of each estimates? How to interpret the odds ratio?
   * Lesson 3.4 - Evaluate model fit and select the best model
     * Learning objective: Talk about the different metrics used to evaluate a regression model fit (ROC, Accuracy, Misclassification rate and other metrics) and how these metrics can be used to select the best model. Also, how to check multicollinearity using VIF?
## Chapter 4 - Understand the algorithms in depth
   * Lesson 4.1 - Gradient Descent, Optimization functions
     * Learning objective: Understand how each model learns on the data and when to stop learning. 
   * Lesson 4.2 - Hyperparameters in Linear and Logistic Regression
     * Learning objective: Explain the different hyperparameters available in sklearn for both Linear and logistic regression and how they change the model fit?
   * Lesson 4.3 - Introduction to case study or project (Optional)
     * Learning objective: Walk through the students to use a sample online dataset to build a logistic regression model? 
## CaseStudy or Project (Optional)
   * Lesson 5.1 - Understand your data
     * Learning objective: Load data into Python and do some basic descriptive stats on the data
   * Lesson 5.2 - Data Transformation
     * Learning objective: Use Python to perform Data transformation on the data
   * Lesson 5.3 - Best predictors
     * Learning objective: Understand how to select the best variables to build your model
   * Lesson 5.4 - Fit model and select best model
     * Learning objective: Fit the regression model using Python, calculate the different metrics to analyze the model fit and select the best model
   * Lesson 5.5 - Save model and score new data
     * Learning objective: How to save your model fit and score new data that comes in future?
